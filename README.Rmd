This repository is a working [R-Research Copmendium](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg) for the manuscript ****. **<description of findings and results>**


### Downloading and Reproducibility 
_N.B._ Structure based on Ben Warrick's [`rrtools`](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) and 
Carl Boettig's [template](https://github.com/cboettig/template) packages. To recreate the analyses are results, initialize the package with the following commands: 

```
git clone https://https://github.com/TriCEM/PFSwDemonDanProphetBrown.git
cd PFSwDemonDanProphetBrown.git
open PFSwDemonDanProphetBrown.git
devtools::install_deps()
```
In addition we use `renv` to track package dependencies for reproducibility. Please use `renv::restore` to restore the state of the project and see https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html for more information.

#### Important Note
For the most part, R seeds are consistent across different operating systems with
the recent exception of `sample` (see discussion [here]() and [release]()). We use 
the code below to align the `sample` functions across our local and remote cluster
machines: 

```
RNGkind(sample.kind = "Rounding")
```

#### Simulations: 
Ran on HTSF SLURM -- TODO

### Structure
The project is structured as follows: 
```
