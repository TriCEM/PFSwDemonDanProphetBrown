This repository is a working [R-Research
Copmendium](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg) for the manuscript
\*\*\*\*. **<description of findings and results>**

### Downloading and Reproducing

*N.B.* Structure based on Ben Warrick’s
[`rrtools`](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) and Carl Boettig’s
[template](https://github.com/cboettig/template) packages. To recreate
the analyses are results, initialize the package with the following
commands:

    git clone https://https://github.com/TriCEM/PFSwDemonDanProphetBrown.git
    cd PFSwDemonDanProphetBrown.git
    open PFSwDemonDanProphetBrown.git
    devtools::install_deps()

In addition we use `renv` to track package dependencies for
reproducibility. Please use `renv::restore` to restore the state of the
project and see <https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html> for
more information.
